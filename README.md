# Spark Vending machine

Our company is growing very fast with many new acquisitions. We are trying to cope with all the demand our employees have for food and beverages.

We estimated that it would be too hard to acquire multiple vending machines and suite them to our needs, therefore we decided to build one on our own. We need your help to do some groundwork!

- An employee can choose from different products: SparklingWater, SparkPasta, SparkSoda. All of them are for free.
- We have an inventory of all available products
- When returning a product, an according item will be removed from the inventory
- When a product in the inventory runs out of stock, it will not be dispensed anymore until it has been restocked
